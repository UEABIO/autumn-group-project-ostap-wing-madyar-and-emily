# Autumn Assignment BIO 5023Y 
Summative group assignment from Wing, Emily, Ostap and Madiyar


## Project description

A group assignment to produce a outbreak situational report of COVID-19 that addresses any topics or trends that are deemed relevant to inform an audience of public health and medical responders. Data was presented via a csv-formatted COVID-19 linelist.

The data is a fake version of a covid linelist a data format for collecting case numbers and information for epidemiology. This data was originally provided by Batra, Neale et al. (2021), The Epidemiologist R Handbook.

Members are responsible for:

Checking the dataset for errors or mistakes

Check that all columns are identified with the correct variable type

Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify topics or trends of importance

Produce one summary figure per person - each figure should be appropriate for the intended audience and may contain annotations or labels to aid explanation. Any requisite summary text to provide context or aid understanding should be included in the final report

Combine all figures with explanatory text into a short (2-page maximum) report compiled with Rmarkdown to be presented at a weekly situation update meeting attended by public health officials and medical responders
