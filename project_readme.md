An outbreak situational report of COVID-19 by Ostap Romanchak, Madiyar Seidaly, Wing Lun Lim, and Emily Chiu. 

### Project description:
To understand the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted exploratory data analysis and explored the following relationships:

* age and COVID-19 deaths,
* gender and COVID-19 deaths, 
* symptoms and hospitalisation, and
* the symptom of headache and positive COVID-19 diagnosis.  

The data was taken from Batra, Neale et al. (2021), The Epidemiologist R Handbook, https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4752646.svg. 

The report and the figures were created using R on RStudio Cloud.
